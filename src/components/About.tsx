      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Everything Emporium, the one-stop shop for literally
        everything you never knew you needed! From backpacks to hard drives,
        rubber chickens to glow-in-the-dark socks, we’ve got it all. If it fits
        in a box (or even if it doesn’t), there’s a good chance we sell it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our story began when our founder, Chadwick “Chaotic” McGadget, realized
        he had way too much stuff in his garage and thought, "Hey, why not just
        sell everything?" One warehouse expansion, three accidental hamster
        invasions, and a mildly concerning surplus of fanny packs later,
        Everything Emporium was born.
